# Exact-Solution-of-2D-Steady-State-Heat-Equation
##### This program evaluates and plots the 2D temperature field T(x,y) for a plate using the Finite Difference Solution Method and the heat equation for different boundary conditions, where:
  * L = 1m
  * W = 1m,
  * T1 = 100 °C
  * T2 = 250 °C
  * dx = dy
